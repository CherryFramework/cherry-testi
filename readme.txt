A testimonials management plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Unveil customers' feedback on your services to look more reliable to prospects. This easy-to-use plugin will let you add testimonials to any post and page of your site via shortcodes.

With Cherry Testimonials, you can prove your testimonials aren't fake and were written by real people. Besides the testimonial itself, it's possible to reveal a lot of details about its author. They include his name, photo, email, company he works in, his position, and link to the site of that company or his personal blog.

Note that you can hide the email, position, company's name, and photo, if a customer doesn't want you to reveal any of that data.

This WordPress plugin gives you freedom to customize testimonials the way you like. Its rich set of configuration options allows you to perform the following actions:

* choose the layout type (list or slider);
* set the number of testimonials to display;
* specify the title and subtitle of the testimonial;

* set the length of testimonials in words;
* set the width of authors' photos in pixels;
* order testimonials by a specific attribute;
* define the category to display testimonials from;
